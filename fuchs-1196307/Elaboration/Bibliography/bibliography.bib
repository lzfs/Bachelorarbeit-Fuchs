  abstract     = {Time-of-Flight ({ToF}) sensors and stereo vision systems are two of the most diffused depth acquisition devices for commercial and industrial applications. They share complementary strengths and weaknesses. For this reason, the combination of data acquired from these devices can improve the ﬁnal depth estimation accuracy. This paper introduces a dataset acquired with a multi-camera system composed by a Microsoft Kinect v2 {ToF} sensor, an Intel {RealSense} R200 active stereo sensor and a Stereolabs {ZED} passive stereo camera system. The acquired scenes include indoor settings with different external lighting conditions. The depth ground truth has been acquired for each scene of the dataset using a line laser. The data can be used for developing fusion and denoising algorithms for depth estimation and test with different lighting conditions. A subset of the data has already been used for the experimental evaluation of the work "Stereo and {ToF} Data Fusion by Learning from Synthetic Data".},

  doi      = {10.1109/JSEN.2021.3051497},
  abstract = {This paper proposes a novel 3D action recognition technique that uses time-series information extracted from depth image sequences for use in systems of human daily activity monitoring. To this end, each action is represented as a multi-dimensional time series, where each dimension represents the position variation of one skeleton joint over time. The time series is then mapped onto a vector space using Dynamic Time Warping ({DTW}) distance. Furthermore, to employ the correlation-distinctiveness relationship of the sequences in recognition, this vector space is remapped onto a discriminative space using the regularized Fisher method, where final decisions about the actions are made. Unlike other available methods, the time-warping used in the mapping strategy makes the feature space robust to temporal variations of the motion sequences. Moreover, our method eliminates the need for a complicated design method for extracting the static and dynamic information of a motion sequence. Furthermore, most existing methods treat all skeletal joints identically for different actions, while some joints are more discriminative to distinguish a specific action. Thanks to the nature of the proposed features, we propose to use a separate set of discriminative joints, called joint importance map for each class of action. Evaluation results on four well-known datasets, {TST}, {UTKinect}, {UCFKinect}, and {NTU} {RGB}+D show competitive performance with the state-of-the-art methods in human action recognition.},

  abstract = {The Azure Kinect is the successor of Kinect v1 and Kinect v2. In this paper we perform brief data analysis and comparison of all Kinect versions with focus on precision (repeatability) and various aspects of noise of these three sensors. Then we thoroughly evaluate the new Azure Kinect; namely its warm-up time, precision (and sources of its variability), accuracy (thoroughly, using a robotic arm), reflectivity (using 18 different materials), and the multipath and flying pixel phenomenon. Furthermore, we validate its performance in both indoor and outdoor environments, including direct and indirect sun conditions. We conclude with a discussion on its improvements in the context of the evolution of the Kinect sensor. It was shown that it is crucial to choose well designed experiments to measure accuracy, since the {RGB} and depth camera are not aligned. Our measurements confirm the officially stated values, namely standard deviation ≤17 mm, and distance error {\textless}11 mm in up to 3.5 m distance from the sensor in all four supported modes. The device, however, has to be warmed up for at least 40–50 min to give stable results. Due to the time-of-flight technology, the Azure Kinect cannot be reliably used in direct sunlight. Therefore, it is convenient mostly for indoor applications.},

We present a literature review of some of the most important publications in the field and classify over 60 published papers from six different perspectives. This review intends to clarify the major concepts with which clustering or classification algorithms are used in visual analytics for time series data and provide a valuable guide for both new researchers and experts in the emerging field of integrating machine learning techniques into visual analytics.},

To investigate the challenges of {HMD} usage in public spaces, existing knowledge can accelerate our understanding on how to attract people’s attention, motivate people to use {HMDs} and overcome barriers that prevent people from using {HMDs} presented in public.

Previous research has revealed the successive engagement phases and zones of the honeypot effect. However, there is little insight into: 1) how people are stimulated to transition between phases; 2) what aspects drive the honeypot effect apart from watching others; and 3) what constraints affect its selfreinforcing performance. In this paper, we discuss the honeypot effect as a spatiotemporal model of trajectories and influences. We introduce the Honeypot Model based on the analysis of observations and interaction logs from Encounters, a public installation that interactively translated bodily movements into a dynamic visual and sonic output. In providing a model that describes trajectories and influences of audience engagement in public interactive systems, our paper seeks to inform researchers and designers to consider contextual, spatial and social factors that influence audience engagement.},

Ambient displays are abstract and aesthetic peripheral displays portraying non-critical information on the periphery of a user’s attention. Although many innovative displays have been published, little existing work has focused on their evaluation, in part because evaluation of ambient displays is diﬃcult and costly. We adapted a low-cost evaluation technique, heuristic evaluation, for use with ambient displays. With the help of ambient display designers, we deﬁned a modiﬁed set of heuristics. We compared the performance of Nielsen’s heuristics and our heuristics on two ambient displays. Evaluators using our heuristics found more, severe problems than evaluators using Nielsen’s heuristics. Additionally, when using our heuristics, 3-5 evaluators were able to identify 40-60\% of known usability issues. This implies that heuristic evaluation is an eﬀective technique for identifying usability issues with ambient displays.},

There seems to be an increased interest in time series clustering as part of the effort in temporal data mining research. To provide an overview, this paper surveys and summarizes previous works that investigated the clustering of time series data in various application domains. The basics of time series clustering are presented, including general-purpose clustering algorithms commonly used in time series clustering studies, the criteria for evaluating the performance of the clustering results, and the measures to determine the similarity/dissimilarity between two time series being compared, either in the forms of raw data, extracted features, or some model parameters. The past researchs are organized into three groups depending upon whether they work directly with the raw data either in the time or frequency domain, indirectly with features extracted from the raw data, or indirectly with models built from the raw data. The uniqueness and limitation of previous research are discussed and several possible topics for future research are identiﬁed. Moreover, the areas that time series clustering have been applied to are also summarized, including the sources of data used. It is hoped that this review will serve as the steppingstone for those interested in advancing this area of research.},

In case of huge datasets, using supervised classification solutions is almost impossible, while clustering can solve this problem using unsupervised approaches.

This study aims to develop and validate a dynamic time warping ({DTW}) based algorithm for assessing Kinect-enabled home-based physical rehabilitation exercises, in order to support auto-coaching in a virtual gaming environment. A {DTW}-based algorithm was ﬁrst applied to compute motion similarity between two time series from an individual user and a virtual coach. We chose eight bone vectors of the human skeleton and body orientation as the input features and proposed a simple but innovative method to further convert the {DTW} distance to a meaningful performance score in terms of the percentage (0–100\%), without training data and experience of experts. The eﬀectiveness of the proposed algorithm was validated through a follow-up experiment with 21 subjects when playing a Tai Chi exergame. Results showed that the algorithm scores had a strong positive linear relationship (r = 0.86) with experts’ ratings and the calibrated algorithm scores were comparable to the gold standard. These ﬁndings suggested that the {DTW}-based algorithm could be eﬀectively used for automatic performance evaluation of an individual when performing home-based rehabilitation exercises.},
